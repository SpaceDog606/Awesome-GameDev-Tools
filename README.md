4. Plask- a programming software that is easy to use. its languages are javascript and WebGL. It is used by most programmers as a prototype for their games rather than the full game. it is mostly used for visuals. :https://motion.plask.ai
5.  GameBench- a performance testing tool, great for checking the requirments for running a game.: https://www.gamebench.net
6.  PlayCanvas- a tool for creating simple web-based games. known for its accesibility and appealing visuals. :https://playcanvas.com

10.  Houdini FX- Art tool for generating amazing FX. liked for its ease of use and amazing visuals.:https://www.sidefx.com/industries/games/

But what are some game development career pathways?
1.Game Programming, obviously. Being a game programmer means that you are the person that makes the game work, without you the game would just be an idea.
2. Game design. The designers of games, they come up with the ideas for the game. The rules and how the game works. their ideas are given to the programmers to be made into reality.
3. Game art. The artist create everything about how the games look. They make it so a game does not need to be text based. Tons of work goes into making every scene or character.
4. Game sound. Game sound designers create the audio for the games. They can take common things and impliment them to sound different. Great audio is an important part of the best games.
5. Game testers. One of the most fun parts, but still not the easiest. Game testers not only play through the game noting every bug they find, but have to try to find ways to break the games. They find the bugs so that the real players dont.

Major disciplines of game programming:
1. Physics programmer: these programmers use math to create the physics for the game. the better job they do, to more realistic the game seems.
2. AI programmer: These ones program the AI in the games, this could be enemies, allies, or even shops that try to predict what the players need.
3. Items programmers: These people program the items for the games. They make anything you pick up work. \
4. Art programmers: They dont make the art, but focus on impliment the art seemlessly into the game, making it less choppy.
5. level programmers: They work with the level designers to make their ideas come to life. They make sure every level is created and works as intended.
